### Status of the Dutch climate (DRAFT)

Simple flow chart for a time series plot:
```{r, InitialFlowChart, echo=FALSE}
graph <- DiagrammeR::mermaid('
  graph RL 
  Obs("Observations") --> |WDF|A
  A("Daily Avg") -->|U|B["Data Acquisition"]
  B --> |WIB|C["Transfomation"]
  B --> |WGB|Bdata(data)
  Bdata --> |U|C
  C --> |WIB|D["Plot"]
  C --> |WGB|Cdata(data)
  Cdata --> |U|D
  D --> |WGB|E["png"]
  ')
saveWidget(graph, 'tmp.html', selfcontained = FALSE)
webshot('tmp.html',
        file = 'inst/img/TimeSeriesPlot.png')
```

- WDF 'was derived by'
- WGB 'was generated by'
- U 'was used by'
- WIB 'was informed by'

<img src="inst/img/TimeSeriesPlot.png" align="middle">

We want to focus on the track from 'Daily Avg' to 'png' for now. A description
of the black box process from the 'Observations' to the 'Daily Avg' product
would be highly appreciated.
